# CSC340 Final Project

The topic I chose for my final project is probability, specifically in the popular casino game, blackjack.

## What you need to run it

First make sure you have python installed on your machine.

Then, make sure to download both python files and put them in the same directory/folder
- blackjack.py
- probability.py

## How to run it
1. Open up your terminal,command prompt, etc... 
2. cd into the directory/folder where you have the two python files 
3. Type in command line `python blackjack.py <number of decks being used>`
